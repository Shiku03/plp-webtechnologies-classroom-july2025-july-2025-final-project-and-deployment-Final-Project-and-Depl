## 🎯 Project Purpose
Grand Vista is a luxury hotel and restaurant website designed to showcase accommodations, dining options, and services while providing an elegant online presence that matches the brand's premium positioning. The website serves as both an informational platform and a booking gateway for potential guests.

## 🌐 Website Structure (5 Pages)

### 1. **Home Page**
The landing page creates an immediate impression of luxury with a full-screen hero section featuring stunning imagery and clear call-to-action buttons. Below the hero, six feature cards highlight the hotel's key offerings: luxury rooms, fine dining, spa services, pool and fitness facilities, prime location, and event spaces. This page is designed to capture attention and guide visitors to explore further.

### 2. **Rooms Page**
This page showcases three accommodation tiers:
- **Deluxe Room** ($150/night) - Entry-level luxury
- **Executive Suite** ($250/night) - Business traveler focused
- **Presidential Suite** ($500/night) - Ultimate luxury experience

Each room is presented with high-quality imagery, detailed amenity lists, and prominent booking buttons. The layout allows guests to compare options and make informed decisions.

### 3. **Restaurant Page**
The dining section features an interactive menu system with category filtering. Visitors can browse through appetizers, main courses, and desserts, each with descriptions and pricing. The menu includes classic fine dining options like Caesar Salad, Grilled Salmon, Ribeye Steak, and Tiramisu, emphasizing the restaurant's culinary excellence.

### 4. **About Page**
This page tells Grand Vista's story, covering:
- **Heritage**: Founded in 1985 with nearly 40 years of hospitality excellence
- **Mission**: Commitment to exceptional guest experiences
- **Values**: Excellence, Integrity, and Hospitality

The content is presented with alternating text and imagery to maintain visual interest and credibility.

### 5. **Contact Page**
A comprehensive contact section provides multiple ways to reach the hotel:
- Physical address and location details
- Phone and email information
- Operating hours for front desk and restaurant
- A functional contact form for inquiries and messages

## ✨ Key Interactive Features

### **Responsive Navigation**
The website includes a fixed header that remains accessible as users scroll. On mobile devices, the navigation collapses into a hamburger menu, ensuring usability across all screen sizes.

### **Dynamic Page Switching**
Rather than loading separate HTML files, the website uses a single-page application approach where clicking navigation links smoothly transitions between different sections, creating a modern, app-like experience.

### **Menu Filtering System**
The restaurant page includes interactive buttons that filter menu items by category (All, Appetizers, Main Course, Desserts), allowing visitors to easily find what they're looking for.

### **Form Validation**
The contact form includes real-time validation that checks for:
- Required fields (name, email, phone, message)
- Proper email format
- Displays error messages for invalid inputs
- Shows success confirmation upon submission

### **Visual Feedback**
Throughout the site, hover effects, smooth animations, and transitions provide visual feedback that enhances user engagement and creates a premium feel.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### **Luxury Aesthetic**
The design uses a gold (#d4af37) accent color paired with elegant typography and sophisticated imagery to convey luxury and exclusivity. The color palette emphasizes class and refinement.

### **User Experience**
The layout prioritizes clarity and ease of navigation. Large, readable fonts, ample white space, and intuitive button placement ensure visitors can quickly find information and take desired actions.

### **Mobile-First Responsiveness**
Every element adapts seamlessly from desktop to tablet to mobile, ensuring the luxury experience translates across all devices.
